# 🎉 BossSensor Setup Complete!

Your BossSensor system is now ready to use! Here's everything you need to know:

## ✅ What You Have

1. **capture_faces.py** - Script to capture training faces from webcam
2. **train_model.py** - Script to train a high-accuracy ML model
3. **boss_detector.py** - Main detection and screen-switching script
4. **Two folders created**:
   - `faces/boss/` - For boss training images
   - `faces/others/` - For other people training images

## 🚀 How to Use (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Capture Boss Images

```bash
python capture_faces.py boss 30
```

- Look at your camera
- Press SPACE to capture each image when you see your face detected
- Capture 25-50 images from different angles
- Press ESC when done

### Step 2: Capture Other People Images

```bash
python capture_faces.py others 25
```

- Have colleagues/friends/family look at camera
- Capture multiple different people
- This helps the AI distinguish between boss and others
- More people = better accuracy

### Step 3: Train the High-Accuracy Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

- This creates a machine learning model
- Uses advanced features like Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and texture analysis
- Will show training accuracy (aim for >90%)
- Saves model to `model/boss_detector.pkl`

### Step 4: Test Detection

```bash
python boss_detector.py --test
```

- Shows real-time face detection and classification
- Check that boss detection works correctly
- Shows confidence scores

### Step 5: Start Monitoring 🎯

```bash
python boss_detector.py --monitor
```

- **AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES TO WORKING SCREEN WHEN BOSS DETECTED**
- Press 'q' to quit
- Press 'h' to manually hide screen
- Press ESC to restore hidden screen

## 🎯 High Accuracy Features

The model uses advanced computer vision techniques:

- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)** - Robust texture features
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** - Edge and shape features
- **Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)** - Advanced texture analysis
- **Multiple classifiers tested** - Automatically selects best performing one
- **Cross-validation** - Ensures model generalizes well
- **Feature scaling** - Optimizes performance

## ⚙️ Configuration

Settings are in `model/config.json`:

```json
{
  "detection_threshold": 0.75, // Higher = more strict (0.6-0.9)
  "consecutive_detections": 3, // Detections needed before hiding (2-5)
  "camera_width": 640, // Camera resolution
  "camera_height": 480,
  "fps": 10, // Frames per second
  "cooldown_time": 5.0 // Seconds before allowing new detection
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Low Accuracy?**

- Capture more training images (50+ per category)
- Ensure good, consistent lighting
- Include variety in poses and expressions

**Boss Not Detected?**

- Lower `detection_threshold` to 0.65
- Check lighting conditions match training
- Capture more boss images in current environment

**False Positives?**

- Increase `detection_threshold` to 0.85
- Add more diverse "others" training images
- Increase `consecutive_detections` to 4-5

**Camera Issues?**

- Close other apps using camera
- Try different USB port
- Check camera permissions

## 🖥️ Raspberry Pi Deployment

For Raspberry Pi 3B (1GB RAM), the system is optimized:

- Lower resolution processing (160x120)
- Efficient feature extraction
- Minimal memory usage
- 5 FPS processing rate

Transfer files and run the same commands on Pi!

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- All processing happens locally on your device
- No data sent to internet
- Training images stored only on your computer
- You have full control over your data

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your BossSensor is ready to keep your screen safe from prying boss eyes!

**Remember**: Use responsibly and have fun! 😄👨‍💼👀

## Quick Commands Summary:

```bash
# 1. Capture training data
python capture_faces.py boss 30
python capture_faces.py others 25

# 2. Train model
python train_model.py

# 3. Start monitoring
python boss_detector.py --monitor
```

**Pro Tip**: Test thoroughly in your actual work environment for best results!
