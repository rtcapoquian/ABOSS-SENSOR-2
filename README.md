## 📖 Detailed Usage Guide

### 🎥 Face Data Collection (`natural_face_capture.py`)

This script captures natural, unenhanced face images for training:

```bash
python natural_face_capture.py <category> <count>
```

**Parameters:**
- `category`: Either "boss" or "others"
- `count`: Number of images to capture (20-30 recommended)

**Features:**
- 🌟 Natural lighting preservation
- 🎯 Automatic face detection and cropping
- 📏 Consistent image sizing (128x128)
- 🔄 Real-time preview with capture countdown
- 💾 Automatic file naming with timestamps

**Controls:**
- `SPACE`: Capture face
- `s`: Skip current frame
- `q`: Quit capture session

### 🧠 Model Training (`train_model.py`)

Advanced machine learning pipeline that creates a highly accurate face classifier:

#### Feature Extraction
The system extracts multiple types of facial features:

1. **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**:
   - Texture analysis using 8-point circular patterns
   - 256-bin histogram normalization
   - Robust to lighting variations

2. **Histogram of Gradients (HOG)**:
   - Edge and gradient information
   - 8x8 grid statistical analysis (mean, std, max)
   - Captures facial structure details

3. **Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)**:
   - Texture relationship analysis
   - 4-direction offset patterns
   - Energy and homogeneity features

4. **Statistical Features**:
   - Global image statistics (mean, std, median, min, max)
   - Percentile analysis (25th, 75th)

#### Model Selection
The system automatically tests multiple classifiers:
- **SVM with RBF kernel**: Non-linear pattern recognition
- **SVM with Linear kernel**: Linear decision boundaries  
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning approach

The best performing model is automatically selected based on cross-validation scores.

#### Performance Evaluation
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold validation for robust accuracy estimation
- **Test set evaluation**: 20% holdout for final performance metrics
- **Classification report**: Precision, recall, F1-score per class
- **Confusion matrix**: Detailed prediction analysis

### 🎯 Real-time Detection (`real_time_labeling.py`)

  - 🔴 Red: Boss detected (high confidence)
  - 🟠 Orange: Boss detected (low confidence)  
  - 🟢 Green: Others detected (high confidence)
  - 🟡 Light Green: Others detected (low confidence)
- 📊 Real-time statistics display
- ⚡ FPS monitoring and performance metrics

**Interactive Controls:**
- `q`: Quit the application

### 🚨 Boss Screen Hider (`boss_screen_hider.py`)

The main production system for automatic boss detection and screen hiding:

#### Instant Detection Mode
- ⚡ **Zero delays**: Immediate response upon boss detection
- 🎯 **30 FPS monitoring**: Maximum responsiveness
- 🖥️ **Full-screen overlay**: Complete screen coverage
- ⌨️ **Keypress exit**: Manual control over overlay removal

#### Background Operation
- 👁️ **Invisible monitoring**: Runs without visible windows
- 🔄 **Continuous scanning**: Always watching for boss appearance
- 💨 **Optimized performance**: Minimal CPU usage
- 🚫 **No false alarms**: High confidence threshold

#### Screen Overlay Features
- 📄 **Custom work screen**: Uses `working_screen.png` as overlay
- 🖥️ **Full-screen coverage**: Covers entire desktop
- 🎨 **Perfect scaling**: Adapts to any screen resolution
- 🔒 **Secure overlay**: Always stays on top

**Usage:**
```bash
python boss_screen_hider.py
```

The system will:
1. 🚀 Load the trained model and configuration
2. 📹 Start background camera monitoring
3. 👁️ Continuously scan for the boss's face
4. 🚨 Instantly display work screen when detected
5. ⌨️ Wait for keypress to remove overlay

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Model Configuration (`model/config.json`)
```json
{
    "detection_threshold": 0.75,
    "consecutive_detections": 3,
    "camera_width": 640,
    "camera_height": 480,
    "fps": 10
}
```

### System Configuration (`config.json`)
```json
{
    "camera_index": 0,
    "debug_mode": false,
    "log_detections": true,
    "screen_image": "working_screen.png"
}
```

## 🎛️ Advanced Configuration

### Detection Threshold Tuning
The detection threshold controls how confident the system must be before triggering:

- **0.5-0.6**: Very sensitive (may have false positives)
- **0.7-0.75**: Balanced accuracy (recommended)
- **0.8-0.9**: Very strict (may miss some detections)

### Performance Optimization
For better performance on slower systems:

1. **Reduce camera resolution**:
   ```python
   self.camera_width = 320
   self.camera_height = 240
   ```

2. **Adjust processing frequency**:
   ```python
   self.process_every_n_frames = 3  # Process every 3rd frame
   ```

3. **Limit face detection**:
   ```python
   self.max_faces = 2  # Process max 2 faces per frame
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Camera Access Problems
```bash
# Check camera permissions
ls /dev/video*

# Test camera access
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened())"
```

#### Model Loading Errors
```bash
# Verify model exists
ls -la model/boss_detector.pkl

# Check model integrity
python -c "import pickle; print(pickle.load(open('model/boss_detector.pkl', 'rb')).keys())"
```

#### Feature Dimension Mismatch
If you see "X has N features but expecting M":
```bash
# Retrain the model with current feature extraction
python train_model.py
```

#### Low Detection Accuracy
1. **Collect more training data**: 30+ images per category
2. **Improve lighting conditions**: Consistent, good lighting
3. **Add variety**: Different angles, expressions, backgrounds
4. **Adjust threshold**: Lower for more sensitivity

#### Performance Issues
1. **Reduce camera resolution**: Edit camera_width/height in config
2. **Increase frame skipping**: Higher process_every_n_frames value
3. **Close unnecessary applications**: Free up CPU resources
4. **Use faster hardware**: Consider system upgrade

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `debug_mode: true` in `config.json`:

```json
{
    "debug_mode": true,
    "log_detections": true
}
```
